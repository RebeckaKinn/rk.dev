# Brief
Develop a SPA (Single Page Application) portfolio website using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS only. 
In other words, no CSS/JS Frameworks are allowed. 

 
The following assignments are required to be featured on your portfolio website:  
- Cross Course Project (Rainydays)  
- JavaScript 1  
- Semester Project 1 

You’re expected to make at least one improvement to the individual projects listed above, 
regardless if you were given feedback on them by your teachers.

Revisit all above mentioned projects and polish them up to be ready to feature on your portfolio website. 

Create (if you haven’t already) or update your own personal GitHub profile README.md to contain the latest information. 
In addition, document each of the required projects by updating their individual README.md files. 
Please see the links to templates below under resources for a guide. 

Write brief reflections of each project in a PDF file. 

Lastly, create a video presentation of the portfolio website. Please refer to the topic 
“Presentation and Professional Documentation” in Module 2 for guidance.
